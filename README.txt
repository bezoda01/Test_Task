To set up selenium, you must use the resources/settings.json file.
settings.json contains some settings: browser selection, current url, screenshots folder, some settings for two browsers (chrome, firefox).
The timeout stage contains the duration of some timeouts.
If you enter more than "0" then selenium will only use implicit waits.
